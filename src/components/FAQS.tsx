            No, reselling or redistributing our beats is strictly

            Under non-exclusive licenses (Basic, Premium, Professional, Legacy),
            registering the beat or your song with any Content Identification

            prohibited.

            However, if you purchase an <strong>Exclusive License</strong>, you
            gain full ownership of the beat and may register your song with
            YouTube Content ID and other platforms.
